# Transit Hub
Transit hub helps users find useful information on travel locations. Users input a country and the app provides information on the country such as its covid 19 status, images, demographics, hotels and attractions. The app uses multiple APIs to accomplish these tasks. These include YelpAPI, UnsplashAPI, RestCountriesAPI, and Covid19API.
